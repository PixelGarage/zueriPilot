Clone Site from GitHub
======================
From a website project only the files in the sites-folder are put under version control (no core files).
In this folder all user files like the folder sites/default/files and the settings.php file (contains credentials) are excluded.

To create a runnable project from a GitHub clone do the following:

Clone GitHub repository:
1) Go to directory ~/Sites. This is the document root of the MAMP Apache server.
2) Extract the newest Drupal Core version to a directory and name it with the project name (e.g. myNewProject).
3) Delete the sites folder.
4) Open PHPStorm. In the dialog under QuickStart choose VCS: Checkout from version control.
5) The 'Clone Repository' dialog opens.
    Choose the repository to be cloned in the dropdown menu.
    Set the parent directory to the newly created project folder (the cloned sites folder will be placed inside this folder)
    Choose always 'sites' for the directory name.
    --> the sites folder is cloned to the new project folder and is connected with the GitHub version for Pull/Push operations.
6) Create an empty folder 'files' in the directory ~/Sites/projectFolder/sites/default or if the project is already published
    on the Stage Server, synchronize the folder from there.

Install the local Database:
1) Create a new DB in local phpMyAdmin with a unique name pixelgar_dp[ProjectName] (use this pattern)
2) Import DB-Backup found in folder sites/default/files_private/backup_migrate/manual/db_xy_stage….mysql.gz into new DB (see phpMyAdmin).
3) Copy the settings.php file from the xySite project into folder ~/Sites/xySite/sites/default (find file in same folder in xySite project)
4) Replace the db name in this file with the project db name (see above).
5) Call localhost/update.php in the browser to update the DB, if necessary.

Start website in browser:
1) Set the document root of MAMP (in Preferences->WeServer) to the new directory, e.g. ~/Sites/projectFolder (important, otherwise site navigation fails)
2) Enter 'localhost' in browser. The project site opens.
3) Login to project site:
User:       dpAdmin
Passwort:	usual

Start implementing in PHPStorm....

PHPStorm:
IMPORTANT!!!!!!! Never work in the Master branch, always create a NEW BRANCH for each task you implement.

1) Add a new branch named with a working title (describing what you are doing in this branch).
2) Implement your task in this branch and push as often as needed to GitHub (code backup).
3) When you're finished with the task, create a Pull Request (in menu VCS->Git->Create Pull Request)
    - asked for merging into Master-Branch
    - give a short description of the work you did, finished...
    - the task will be merged into the Master by an admin (a discussion about the changes in the branch can be hold on GitHub before integration)
4) Open a new branch for another task you implement, etc.etc.





Installation of new local Drupal Site
=====================================

Local File structure:
1) Go to directory ~/Sites. This is the document root of the MAMP Apache server.
2) Extract the newest Drupal Core version to a directory and name it with the project name (e.g. myNewProject).
3) Open the xySite project in PHPStorm and pull the newest version from GitHub.
4) Copy sites-folder of the xySite-Project to the Drupal directory (replacing the sites-Folder of Drupal Core)
5) IMPORTANT!!!!
    Delete .git folder in the copied sites-folder to avoid a synchronisation with the xySite
    (the .git-folder is hidden, show it by entering 'showFiles' in Terminal Application)

Install the local Database:
1) Create a new DB in local phpMyAdmin with a unique name pixelgar_dp[ProjectName] (use this pattern)
2) Import DB-Backup found in folder sites/default/files_private/backup_migrate/manual/db_xy_stage….mysql.gz into new DB (see phpMyAdmin).
3) Replace db-name in settings.php with the new one. User is always pixelgar_dpUser (has all rights).

Start website in browser:
1) Set the document root of MAMP (in Preferences->WeServer) to the new directory, e.g. ~/Sites/newProject (important, otherwise site navigation fails)
2) Enter 'localhost' in browser. The new site opens.
3) Login to new site:
User:       dpAdmin
Passwort:	usual

Change basic site settings:
1) The basic modules are enabled and configured. Enable additional modules used for the project.
2) Update all modules to the newest version

Settings:
1) A basic setup is already configured. Change following settings to the corresponding values of your site:
    Backup and migrate: db backup name and profile
    Theme: site name, slogan, logo, email etc…


PHPStorm:
1) Add the new Project files to PHPStorm
2) Add the sites folder to Git with Menu VCS->Import into version control->Create Git repository...
3) Commit the first version
4) Add a new branch with a working title (describing what you are doing in this branch).
5) IMPORTANT!!!!!!! Only work in this branch. Push often to the GitHub (code backup).
6) When you're finished with the branch, create a Pull Request (in menu VCS->Git->Create Pull Request)
    - asked for merging into Master-Branch
    - give a short description of the work you did, finished...
7) Open a new branch for another task you implement, etc.etc.
